* What is ABCL?

  From [[https://abcl.org][ABCL's Home Page]]

  #+begin_quote
  Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) is a full implementation of the Common Lisp
  language featuring both an interpreter and a compiler, running in the
  JVM. Originally started to be a scripting language for the J editor, it now
  supports JSR-223 (Java scripting API): it can be a scripting engine in any
  Java application. Additionally, it can be used to implement (parts of) the
  application using Java to Lisp integration APIs.
