# What is ABCL?

From [ABCL's Home Page](https://abcl.org)

> Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) is a full implementation of the Common Lisp language featuring both an interpreter and a compiler, running in the JVM. Originally started to be a scripting language for the J editor, it now supports JSR-223 (Java scripting API): it can be a scripting engine in any Java application. Additionally, it can be used to implement (parts of) the application using Java to Lisp integration APIs.

# How to use this iamge


<a id="orgb45ff03"></a>

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your ABCL project

```dockerfile
FROM %%IMAGE%%:latest
COPY . /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
CMD [ "abcl", "--load", "./your-daemon-or-script.lisp" ]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-abcl-app
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-abcl-app
```


<a id="org8ec9d53"></a>

## Run a single Common Lisp script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete \`Dockerfile\`. In such cases, you can run a Lisp script by using the ABCL Docker image directly:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app %%IMAGE%%:latest abcl --load ./your-daemon-or-script.lisp
```


<a id="org98391d6"></a>

## Developing using SLIME

[SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) provides a convenient and fun environment for hacking on Common Lisp. To develop using SLIME, first start the Swank server in a container:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name abcl-slime -p 127.0.0.1:4005:4005 -v /path/to/slime:/usr/src/slime -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app %%IMAGE%%:latest abcl --load /usr/src/slime/swank-loader.lisp --eval '(swank-loader:init)' --eval '(swank:create-server :dont-close t :interface "0.0.0.0")'
```

Then, in an Emacs instance with slime loaded, type:

```emacs
M-x slime-connect RET RET RET
```

# Image variants

This image comes in several variant, each designed for a specific use case.


<a id="org50a7673"></a>

## `%%IMAGE%%:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

Some of these tags may have names like buster or stretch in them. These are the suite code names for releases of Debian and indicate which release the image is based on. If your image needs to install any additional packages beyond what comes with the image, you'll likely want to specify one of these explicitly to minimize breakage when there are new releases of Debian.

This tag attempts to replicate the base environment provided by buildpack-deps. It, by design, has a large number of extremely common Debian packages.


<a id="org96159d5"></a>

## `%%IMAGE%%:<version>-slim`

This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run ABCL. Unless you are working in an environment where only this image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.


<a id="org103d076"></a>

## `%%IMAGE%%:<version>-windowsservercore`

This image is based on [Windows Server Core (`microsoft/windowsservercore`)](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore). As such, it only works in places which that image does, such as Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise (Anniversary Edition) or Windows Server 2016.
